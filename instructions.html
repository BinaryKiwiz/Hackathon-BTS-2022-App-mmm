                    <h2>Clearing Trail Corridor</h2>
                      <li>
                        There are specific U.S.F.S. standards for trail widths and heights, generally about 8 ft. wide and 10 ft. high, however these can be varied based on several different factors. Be sure to check with U.S.F.S. trail workers before deciding how to cut the corridor.
                      </li>
                      <ul>
                      <li>
                        Vegetation type and growth rate- Some species do not grow over a certain height or width and are not typically a problem in the corridor such as flowers or berries. These can be left to help enhance the natural beauty of the trail. However, tree saplings in the corridor should be removed. Species that grow very fast such as willows should also be removed or heavily trimmed.
                      </li>               
                  
                  <li>
                    <b>Type of Users</b> - Consider who is using the trail. Equestrians need a wider corridor and more importantly a higher trail ceiling, usually at least 10 ft. high. Hikers do no not need as high or as wide of a corridor so if it is exclusively a hiking trail, the corridor can be tighter. Mountain bike trails lie somewhere in between as they need good sight distance around corners and room to maneuver around obstacles.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Speed of Users</b> - This mostly applies to mountain bikers. A tighter corridor will slow bikers while an open corridor will invite more speed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Number of Users</b> - Trails with high amounts of traffic need a larger corridor to allow for passing and visibility around corners.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Maintenance frequency</b> - If this trail typically only gets brushed once every few years cut the corridor wider and higher to allow room for growth. If it gets brushed every year, cut the corridor to the exact parameters.
                  </li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <h2>Trimming and cutting branches</h2>
                
                        <li>
                            Be sure to use the proper tool when cutting brush and limbs. If the vegetation is clearly too thick for loppers, use a pruning saw. Conversely, use loppers for small brush rather than trying to mow it down with a pruning saw.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The thickened section of bark just outside the spot where a branch joins the tree is called the “bark collar”. When cutting branches, always cut just to the outside of this. Make sure it is cut flat and not pointed in any way as this could injure other passing users.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When cutting large branches, make a partial cut underneath before cutting down from the top. This will ensure that the cut is clean and doesn’t strip away bark when it falls.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                            Place all cut brush as far away as possible from the trail corridor, at least out of sight, with the butt end facing away from the trail.
                        </li>
                </ul>


                <ul>
                    <h2>Rock Work</h2>
                
                        <li>
                            Do I remove the rock or leave it?
                        </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    It depends. On bench cut trail on side hills, remove the rocks from the inside edges. These will only push users to the outside edge of the trail and cause the tread to creep downhill. Placing rocks at random places on the outside of the tread however can serve to keep users in the center of the tread. Be sure to dig these in well and make sure they are large enough to stay in place. Do not line the outside edge with rocks as this will cause water to get trapped on the tread.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If you are on a horse trail, rocks that are too large can cause a slipping hazard for horses and should be removed and filled with gravel and dirt. Sharp, pointy rocks should also be removed as they tend to force users off the trail.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If a rock is loose, it should be removed.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Find the appropriate rock for the appropriate spot. Take measurement s if necessary to ensure that you do not waste your energy moving a rock that doesn’t fit.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If you are retrieving a rock for a rock wall or to help support a structure, ask for help and go big. When building with rock we want these structures to last forever so find a big, solid rock that won’t move even if kicked or stepped on.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                    <h2>Digging Bench and Switchbacks</h2>
                
                        <li>
                            A full bench trail is constructed by cutting the full width of the tread into the hillside, which is about one Pulaski length. The entire tread is dug down to compacted mineral soil.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Full bench is preferable in almost all cases as it is far more sustainable in the long term.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On flat ground, full bench construction is not needed and more of a partial cut can be done
                        </li>
                        <ol> 
                            Clear debris and mark tread line
                        </ol>
                        <li>
                            Before digging, be sure to ask FS employees how the tread has been flagged as this can differ. Sometimes the top of the cut is flagged, sometimes the centerline, or sometimes the bottom edge of the tread.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Scratch a line between flags to help serve as a guide and then clear away topsoil and any organic material down to the mineral soil. Broadcast organic material as far as possible down the slope.
                        </li>
                        <ol> 
                            Cut the backslope
                        </ol>
                        <li>
                            The backslope is the uphill side of the tread where it blends into the slope above the trail. It is very important to match the backslope of your tread to the existing slope of the land.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use a grubbing tool to dig into the slope and broadcast all material as you dig. Do not pile up dirt on the bottom side of your tread! This is not stable and will not last through the years of use!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pay attention as you dig! Following the flag line is very important as any deviation could affect the grade of the trail. Create a solid, slightly out-sloped tread.
                        </li>
                        <ol> 
                            Disperse downhill debris
                        </ol>
                        <li>
                            Use a shovel or mcleod to pull down all lose dirt and debris from the bottom edge off the trail. Disperse debris as far as possible so that underlying plants can come back.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After dispersing debris, re-check your bench and see just how wide and solid it is. Take the time to dig further if necessary and make it right!!
