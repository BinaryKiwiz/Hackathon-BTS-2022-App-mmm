    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
    <blockquote>
      Our mission is to provide service to our community through trail renovation. As two of our group members being Eagle Scouts and avid hikers, the trails have given us adventure, camraderie, and a greater appreciation of nature. Our mission is to give back to these trails while also providing volunteer opportunities for our community. TransformATrail's versatility allows for newer possibilities to further expand its community outreach, and we are committed to bringing this opportunity to all.
